# LT Method

This helper uses an LT-first workflow for direct TeX-to-Verso chapter work.
`LT` is the canonical term. `LF` (`LaTeX Fidelity`) and `TF` (`Translation
Faithfulness`) are accepted aliases for the same workflow.

## Core Rules

- Do not trust older LT-pass labels by themselves. Under the current method, a
  chapter is not treated as LT-audited until each translated informal block has
  a local adjacent `tex` witness.
- Preserve paragraph boundaries, sentence order, section order, labeled theorem
  order, and local claim order unless a concrete Verso or build constraint
  forces a change.
- Translate TeX layout into Verso with the smallest possible editorial
  footprint. Do not smooth or summarize the prose just because it reads better.
- If the source uses mathematical notation, keep it as mathematics where
  practical rather than demoting it into code spans.
- Valid Verso inline math opens with `$`` and closes with the final backtick
  alone. Because this overlaps with Markdown-style backticks, be conservative:
  do not transform already-valid `$`...`` into the malformed form `$`...`$`.
- Keep prose as prose unless the source already has a corresponding theorem,
  definition, lemma, corollary, proof, or similar graph-visible source object.
- Preserve theorem-like environment kind faithfully. Do not translate a TeX
  lemma, corollary, definition, or proof into a generic `:::theorem` wrapper.
- Do not use `:::theorem` as a generic wrapper for theorem-like source blocks.
- Preserve TeX `\uses{...}` edges when they carry real dependency meaning, but
  do not invent new dependency edges just to improve graph shape.
- Treat metadata cleanup as a second phase of LT rather than as a substitute
  for LT. First pair the text with a source witness, then tighten
  `(lean := "...")` and `{uses "..."}[]`.
- When non-literal material is unavoidable, keep it visibly separate and label
  it as an editorial or harness note.

## Witness Discipline

- Each translated informal block should sit immediately next to a labeled
  `tex` block carrying the corresponding TeX source.
- Prefer one translated block per witness block when practical.
- If the translation is not ready yet, keep the source locally in a `tex`
  witness rather than filling the gap with placeholder prose.
- If a block has low LT similarity, first ask whether the witness is oversized
  or misaligned before rewriting faithful prose.

## Triage Order For Low-Similarity Blocks

1. shrink or split the witness to the exact source span
2. remove invented summary structure
3. restore missing source-grounded intermediate nodes
4. only then rewrite the translated prose
5. if none of that yields a trustworthy LT block, fall back to raw `tex`

## Validation Loop

After a coherent direct-port batch, run:

```bash
python3 tools/verso-harness/scripts/check_lt_source_pairs.py --project-root . path/to/Chapter.lean
python3 tools/verso-harness/scripts/check_lt_similarity.py --project-root . path/to/Chapter.lean
python3 tools/verso-harness/scripts/check_blueprint_node_kinds.py --project-root . path/to/Chapter.lean
python3 tools/verso-harness/scripts/check_verso_math_delimiters.py --project-root . path/to/Chapter.lean
```

Use `lt_audit.py --node-kinds --math-sanity` when you also want the focused
chapter build, optional pages smoke test, the graph-visible node-kind check,
and the conservative math-delimiter check.

Use `lt_audit.py --native-warnings` when you want the focused chapter build to
fail on Lean, Verso, or VersoBlueprint warnings. Generated consumers disable
the noisy `VersoManual` inline-code line-length warning by default, so this is
intended for math lint and other structural warning surfaces rather than prose
formatting noise.
Imported upstream warnings also count here. If the vendored formalization still
emits transitive `declaration uses 'sorry'` warnings, treat a
`--native-warnings` failure as upstream-only until that upstream warning debt is
cleaned.

The default `lt_audit.py` native warning mode follows
`harness.native_warnings` in `verso-harness.toml`, and generated consumers keep
the version-appropriate `strictResolve` lean option aligned with
`harness.strict_external_code`.
